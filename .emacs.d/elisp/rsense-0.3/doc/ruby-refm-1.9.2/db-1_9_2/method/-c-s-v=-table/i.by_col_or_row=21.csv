自身をミックスモードに変更します。

Switches the mode of this table to mixed mode.  All calls to indexing and
iteration methods will use the default intelligent indexing system until
the mode is changed again.  In mixed mode an index is assumed to be a row
reference while anything else is assumed to be column access by headers.

This method returns the table and is safe to chain.
