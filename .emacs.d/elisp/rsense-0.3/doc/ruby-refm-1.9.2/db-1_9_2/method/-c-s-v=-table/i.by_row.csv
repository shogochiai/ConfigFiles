--- by_row -> CSV::Table

Returns a duplicate table object, in row mode.  This is handy for chaining
in a single call without changing the table mode, but be aware that this
method can consume a fair amount of memory for bigger data sets.

This method returns the duplicate table for chaining.  Don't chain
destructive methods (like []=()) this way though, since you are working
with a duplicate.
